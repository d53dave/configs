# configs

To be more hipster, ditch `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`, and go for `fish` and `oh-my-fish`. 

```
brew install fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
omf install bobthefish
```

Because you are so leet, you use [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Of course you do. Anyway, your `fish_right_prompt.fish` depends on it.

```
brew install ripgrep
```

Don't forget to move `rg.fish` to `$HOME/.config/fish/completions`
